              description: 'ObjectReference contains enough information to let you
                inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this type are
                discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not
                generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are
                both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It
                is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions like, "must
                refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be
                restricted".     Those cannot be well described when embedded.  3.
                Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                what will happen.  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                is on the group,resource tuple     and the version of the actual struct
                is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                is embedded in many locations, updates to this type     will affect
                numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API
                type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                  description: 'If referring to a piece of an object instead of an
                    entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field
                    access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                    a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                    (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                    (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only
                    to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
